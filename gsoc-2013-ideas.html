  <h3><a href="https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle">sevntu.checkstyle</a></h3>

    <b>Brief explanation:</b>
      Main idea of <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is to automate and ease code-review process and following code-standard, and force minors to be fixed just as developer save a file. As we confinsed that changing a code is easie during writing but not after commit/push.
      This project contains number of Checks that help your team to write code in almost the same style to remove understanding-threthold for new developers to examine a code.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Our project is extension to <a href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/">EclipseCS plugin</a>, we are in update site of that project in "Uncategorized" group. List of our already implemented Checks is <a href="http://sevntu-checkstyle.github.com/sevntu.checkstyle/">here</a>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We are incubator for Checkstyle Checks that are not present in main stream of Checkstyle project, or not yet in that project.
      Unfortunately generating an idea of new code-rule is not trivial task, and not all in community will share same ideas, idea have 
      to be prooven and tested throughly on a wide range of projects in opensource community to come up in main project and is used by most developers. Each idea of code standard is controversial and it is partly religion question, so we do not expect to be welcome in all developer groups.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We grab ideas from our experiense, from books, blogs, forums, from other static code analysis application and just automate them,
      to avoid describing best practices and code-standard points for developers over and over on code-review.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We do contribute all our Checks to Checkstyle project as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/checkstyle/patches/">patches</a>, and will always do.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We have ideas and we cannot wait till Checkstyle project apply our patches, we allow to use our ideas for Eclipse users right now
      with ease to use only that Checks that they require and they see a reason. 
      But we also provide extension with the same functionality to maven-chestyle-plugin so you can <a href="https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/checkstyle-samples">use our Checks</a> in maven site generation, build validation or.
      <br/> 
      <br/>
      We offer diversity of Checks and each company choose what to use to satisfy their code-standard neeeds.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This project is the best way to study Java from syntax point view and encorporating best practicing from the begining of developer carier. After writing a Check student will get knowledge about automation for problem detection in code, and he will use that results at all his work places in future, and help all other developers not to write and 'bad' code anymore. Writing a Check require only basic Java knowledge, code of one Check is in average 400 lines so make it easy to finish task for student.

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/EclipseDSM/Eclipse-DSM-viewer">Eclipse-DSM-viewer</a></h3>

    <b>Brief explanation:</b>
      <br/>
      Dependency Structure Matrices (DSMs) are very poverful approach in the analysis of software architecture and design as it allows the developer or architect to see inter-module dependencies than traditional "<a href="https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/framework/design-docs/dependency-analysis/root-package-graph.png/image_view_fullscreen">box and arrows</a>" techniques which become to difficult to use for applications that are bigger then 20 classes. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Dependency analys is usually under-estimated during development or even completely ignored. Because it shows its reason 
      only on stage when you try to devide your project/class into two, or try to refactor code or exchange part of project/class with new implementation. The more dependecies your class have the more complicated or painful refactoring will be. Most of dependecies are just unintended, remnants after refactoring, incorrect selection during suggestions by Intellisense suggestions (developer was too tiered to notice that he used util class from UI package in class from DAO package). In time, other developers will not dare to change that magic code.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      DSM already exist in popular IDEs (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/dependency_analysis.html">Idea</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gunnarpeipman/archive/2009/11/05/visual-studio-2010-visualizing-dependencies.aspx">MS Visual Studio</a>), and as separate application <a href="http://www.lattix.com/files/dl/slides/s.php?directory=4tour">Latix</a>, <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/Doc_Matrix.aspx">NDepend</a>, <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Cycles+-+Dependency+Structure+Matrix">Sonar</a>. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Our idea to create native to Eclipse plugin with free license to let all Eclipse developers to encorporate DSM analysis during development but not as "after commit" analysis. In that milestone we will focus on UI presentation, DSM structure will be taken from opensource library <a href="http://web.sysart.fi/dtangler/">dtangler</a>, additionally we will focus on convenience to use in Eclipse and navigation from matrix to real code. Usage of dtangler library was already succesfuly tested in our <a href="https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/dsm-maven-plugin">dsm-maven-plugin</a>. Detailed description of Eclipse-dsm-viewer project could be found <a href="http://eclipsedsm.github.com/Eclipse-DSM-viewer/">here</a>.

    <b>Expected results:</b>
    <lu>
      <li> integration with Eclipse (popup menus, preferences, rendering in view) </li>
      <li> exiting or self written UI contoll have to be used to show dependency matrix in a similar was as shown <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/wp-content/img/expandedDependencies3.gif">here</a>. With features to draw under level of dependecies in the same perspective as upper levels. </li>
      <li> coloring of Matrix to highlight cyrcles, dependency "from" and "to", difference in levels, strength of dependecy to others. </li>
      <li> navigation from Matrix to Java code editor. </li>
      <li> Plugin have to be tested agains huge opensource projects(Spring, Hibernate, Log4j, ...) to test its usability and performance. </li>
